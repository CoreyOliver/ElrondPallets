**Pre integration Version

Project:

App to contain carton ID input for warehouse pallet 'license plate'. Project was adopted and changes in production are proprietary per org.

Changes post adoption:
Adjusted views to React from EJS. moved from MongoDB to another DB. 

What I learned:

The benefits of MVC. Updating the views and database was seamless. Few adjustments to controllers to accommodate new request structure but there was no need to restructure the entire app. 

separation of routing paths. Another level of organization that was appreciated when debugging.
